## INGRESS CONTROLLER IS NOT A LOAD BALANCER, BUT A "ROUTER"

### **The Role of Ingress Controller**
- The **Ingress Controller** is responsible for routing **external HTTP(S)** traffic to the correct **Kubernetes services** based on **Ingress rules**.
- It operates at **Layer 7 (Application Layer)** and typically handles:
  - **Host-based routing** (e.g., `api.example.com` vs. `www.example.com`).
  - **Path-based routing** (e.g., `/api` vs. `/web`).

It routes traffic to the **Kubernetes Service** (a layer 4 load balancer) that is associated with the corresponding set of pods.
  
However, **external traffic** still needs to reach the **Ingress Controller** in the first place. This is where you might need:
1. **Load Balancer** (like MetalLB or a cloud-native load balancer): To handle traffic **outside the cluster** and route it to the Ingress Controller.
2. **DNS Configuration**: To point external users to the correct public IP where the Ingress Controller is accessible.

### **Summary**
1. **External Traffic** → **Ingress Controller** (Layer 7) → **Kubernetes Service** (Layer 4) → **Pods**
   - **Ingress Controller**: Routes traffic to services (Layer 7 routing). Decides **which service** (or backend) should handle the incoming traffic based on its rules (path, hostname).
   - **Kubernetes Service**: Balances traffic across pods (Layer 4 load balancing). Actually balances the traffic **between the pods** for that service.
