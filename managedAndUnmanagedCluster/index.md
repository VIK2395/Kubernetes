### Cluster on On-promises
- Create a cluster from a scratch. We need to create and manage everithing yourselves
  - Create and manage **master** and worker nodes.

### Cluster on Cloud
- Managed service.
  - Most setup is automated and done by cloud provider
  - We select number of worker nodes with everything pre-installed
  - Master nodes are managed and created by cloud provider. So we only pay for worker nodes.
